QUESTION:
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
         hl = len(haystack)
         nl = len(needle)
         for i in range(0,hl-nl+1):
            if haystack[i:i+nl] == needle:
                return i
         return -1
        
EXAMPLE:
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
CONSTRAINT:
1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
