Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        s1 = []
        for i in list(s):
            if i.isalnum():
                s1.append(i.lower())
            else:
                pass
        return s1 == s1[::-1]
EXAMPLE:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
