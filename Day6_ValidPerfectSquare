QUESTION:
Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def isPerfectSquare(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if (int(num ** 0.5) == num ** 0.5):
            return True
        else:
            return False
Example
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
