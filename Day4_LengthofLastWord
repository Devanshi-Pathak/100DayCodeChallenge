QUESTION:
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substringconsisting of non-space characters only.
CODE:
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        for w in s.split(' ')[::-1]:
            if w != '':
                return len(w)
 OR
 class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        i , length = len(s) - 1 , 0
        while s[i] == " ":
            i -= 1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != " ":
            length += 1
            i -= 1
        return length
EXAMPLE:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
